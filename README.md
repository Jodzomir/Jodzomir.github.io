This website showcases some of my projects, skills, and experiences as a developer. It is designed to be simple, clean, and easy to navigate.

Currently, the website includes the following sections:


1. Home: A brief introduction to who I am and what I do

2. Projects: A showcase of some of my favorite projects, along with descriptions, screenshots, and links to their live versions

3. Skills: A list of the programming languages, frameworks, and tools I'm proficient in

4. About: More detailed information about my background, education, and work experience

5. Blog: A section where I write articles about programming, technology, or other topics that interest me

6. Contact: A contact form (coming soon with emailjs) to allow visitors to send me messages directly from the website

7. Dark Mode: A toggle to switch between light and dark mode for better accessibility and user experience.

8. Download CV: A button to download my resume/CV, which contains my professional experience, education, and other relevant information.

In the near future, I plan to implement the following features:


1. Contact Form with EmailJS: I will add a contact form powered by emailjs to allow visitors to send me messages directly from the website


2. More Projects: As I continue to work on new projects, I will add them to the website to keep it up-to-date with my latest work


3. Project Filters: A filter system to allow visitors to filter projects by category, language, or other criteria


4. Testimonials: A section to showcase testimonials from clients or colleagues


5. Newsletter: A newsletter signup form to keep visitors updated on my latest projects and blog posts.
